# TO DO

- do something related to networking as a project (some game)
- try to add particles.js
- make the interface completely CRUD if signed in
- add chess board
- maybe add a second accent colour
- maybe have accent colours as variables to make it easier to switch
- use max(36px, 4vw) typa css for dynamic font sizes
- on gallery, if you click photo on the right, it expands to full dimension in the centre and rest gets translucent behind. clicking outside image after expanding goes back to default.
- add option to subscribe to mailing list. add option to send mailing list on admin login.
- on blogs, like [this website](https://camillemormal.com/about) make a scrollable mini view on the left and bigger view of specific blogs on right.
